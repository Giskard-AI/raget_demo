{"recommendation": "To improve your RAG system, focus on enriching the knowledge base and refining the retriever for topics with lower scores, particularly \"Global GHG Emissions\" and \"Climate Change Assessment,\" and enhance the rewriter component to better handle conversational and double questions, as they have the lowest scores among question types. Additionally, ensure the generator is well-tuned to maintain high performance on complex and situational questions."}
