It re\ufb02ects the increasing diversity of those involved in \nclimate action. \nThis report integrates the main \ufb01ndings of the AR6 Working Group \nreports58 and the three AR6 Special Reports59. It recognizes the \ninterdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human \nsocieties; the value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close \nlinkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem \nhealth, human well-being and sustainable development. Building on \nmultiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and \nsocial sciences, this report identi\ufb01es opportunities for transformative \naction which are effective, feasible, just and equitable using concepts \nof systems transitions and resilient development pathways60. Different \nregional classi\ufb01cation schemes61 are used for physical, social and \neconomic aspects, re\ufb02ecting the underlying literature.\nAfter this introduction, Section 2, \u2018Current Status and Trends\u2019, opens \nwith the assessment of observational evidence for our changing \nclimate, historical and current drivers of human-induced climate \nchange, and its impacts. It assesses the current implementation of \nadaptation and mitigation response options.

{"text":"85\nLong-Term Climate and Development Futures\nSection 3\n3.3.2 Net Zero Emissions: Timing and Implications\nFrom a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused \nglobal warming to a speci\ufb01c level requires limiting cumulative \nCO2 emissions, reaching net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, \nalong with strong reductions of other GHG emissions \n(see Cross-Section Box.1). Global modelled pathways that reach \nand sustain net zero GHG emissions are projected to result in \na gradual decline in surface temperature (high con\ufb01dence). \nReaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in \nCO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and implies net negative \nCO2 emissions.134 Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary to \nachieve net negative CO2 emissions135. Achieving global net zero \nCO2 emissions, with remaining anthropogenic CO2 emissions balanced by \ndurably stored CO2 from anthropogenic removal, is a requirement to \nstabilise CO2-induced global surface temperature increase (see 3.3.3) \n(high con\ufb01dence). This is different from achieving net zero GHG \nemissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions (see \nCross-Section Box.1) equal CO2 removal (high con\ufb01dence). Emissions \npathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions de\ufb01ned by the \n100-year global warming potential imply net negative CO2 emissions \nand are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature \nafter an earlier peak (high con\ufb01dence). While reaching net zero CO2 or net \nzero GHG emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross \nemissions, the deployment of CDR to counterbalance hard-\nto-abate residual emissions (e.g., some emissions from agriculture, \naviation, shipping, and industrial processes) is unavoidable (high \ncon\ufb01dence)."}

When CO2 is captured directly from the \natmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO2 capture and subsurface injection is a mature technology for \ngas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it \nis a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated to be on the order of 1000 GtCO2, which is more than the CO2 storage requirements through \n2100 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, although the regional availability of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and \nmanaged, it is estimated that the CO2 can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological \nenvironmental and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C.

The range of \nsuch positive interactions is signi\ufb01cant in the landscape of near-term \nclimate policies across regions, sectors and systems.

When such options are combined with broader sustainable \ndevelopment objectives, they can yield greater bene\ufb01ts for human well-being, social equity and justice, and \necosystem and planetary health.
